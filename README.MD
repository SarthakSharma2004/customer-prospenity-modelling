# WanderWells Travels – Customer Propensity Modeling

*Predicting which customers are most likely to purchase the “Bliss Retreat Wellness Package” using data-driven insights.*


---


## 🌍 Project Overview

WanderWells Travels, a rapidly growing luxury travel company, aims to revolutionize customer targeting for its newest offering — the Zen Escape Wellness Package 🧘‍♀️✨

Previously, marketing campaigns reached customers randomly, leading to high costs and low conversion rates.

This project uses machine learning and data analytics to identify which customers are most likely to purchase the new package — helping the marketing team work smarter, not harder.


---



## 🎯 Objective

To build a predictive model that classifies potential customers into two groups:

* Likely to Purchase 🟢

* Not Likely to Purchase 🔴

This helps the marketing team focus resources on the most promising leads, thereby reducing costs and boosting sales.


---



## 📊 About the Data

*Dataset Link*

[Tour Package Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanamps/tourpackageprediction)


The dataset contains information about customer demographics, behavior, and interactions with the sales team.


---



## 🧠 Approach

1. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Identified correlations between income, occupation, and package purchase rate

* Visualized demographic patterns using Seaborn and Matplotlib


---



2. 🧹 Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values

* Encoded categorical features 

* Scaled numerical features

* Created new impactful features from existing ones


---



3. 🤖 Model Development 

Trained multiple classification models:

* XGBoost
* Random Forest
* GradientBoostingClassifier
* AdaBoostClassifier
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

XGBOOST CLASSIFIER was selected as the best-performing classifier model after hyperparameter tuning.

## 🌐 Model Deployment

Exposed model predictions via FastAPI , Dockerised the API and deployed it on AWS (EC2)
Integrated frontend using Streamlit , deployed using render
